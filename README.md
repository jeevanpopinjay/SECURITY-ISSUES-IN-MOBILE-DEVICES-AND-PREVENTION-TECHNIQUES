Abstract— Mobile phones, to be more specific  smartphones have become like a part of everyday  life. They have become more than a device used  for just communication, people use them almost  for everything, starting from using like an alarm  clock to the device which stores almost all of the  important data and also a means to pay bills  online using the account and card details stored  in their phone’s memory.
